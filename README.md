# Super Party Jam

> Note: This project is due for re-branding. The final name will be "Super Party Jam", with the Sonic the Hedgehog inspired minigames shifted into an official Mod/DLC. Both will be free and open source.

Super Party Jam is an open-source collection of party games inspired by the likes of Kahoot and TJPP. These games run on your local network, and thus can be played without an internet connection.

Made with Godot 4.3 w/ C#, Svelte and lots of spaghetti code.

## This project is unfinished!
